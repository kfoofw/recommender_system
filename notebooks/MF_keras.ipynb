    "# Keras Embedding layers\n",
    "Using Keras, we are able to represent Matrix Factorisation (MF) with its Embedding layers. The Embedding layer is commonly used to convert discrete data that might be represented by sparse one-hot encoding into a dense representation with a specified input for hidden dimensionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "For intuition, the Embedding layers are often used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) with text formatting, where words or sequences of words (n-grams) can be used \n",
    "\n",
    "The key inputs for the Embedding layer consists of: \n",
    "- `input_dim`: The number of feature dimensions. In NLP, this refers to the expected vocabulary size for the corpus. In recommenders MF, this represents the number of users or items.\n",
    "- `output_dim`: The hidden/latent dimensionality for dense representation.\n",
    "- `input_length`: This refers to the sequence length that is often used in NLP for n-grams. For recommenders MF, this remains as 1 since the data used does not have sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring the effect of `input_length` since it is 1, what the Embedding layer does is that it constructs a reduced representation of the work as represented by `input_dim` by `output_dim` which is similar to the U or M matrices in MF. Thus, for a given user or item, it is represented by a vector of shape (1 by `hidden_dimension`) in dense representation."
